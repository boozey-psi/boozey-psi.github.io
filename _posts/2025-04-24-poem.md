I chose the yellow trumpet \
For a nice cow itch \
I hope the red spreads \
Like its vines or its pitch \
I can’t get enough \
Of this jazzy jungle \
Why not choose a lute? \
Why not choose the Umbel? \
A well kept sound \
And you keep your skin \
But I’d rather touch one’s coils \
And discover it’s sin \
I cant say praise be \
Without meeting the tree \
I cant claim to be free \
With no divorcee \
To fall face first \
And know the impenitent \
Intimately, openly \
And if a touch is vesicant \
Then rub them all over me \
And peel off my exterior \
I dont know what else would \
Sever me from the inferior
