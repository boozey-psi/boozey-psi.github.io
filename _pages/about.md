# Time-Energy Uncertainty from Einstein's Box
Early 20th century literature showcases the time-energy uncertainty relation (UR) as simply a vague re-expression of the momentum-position UR. Only at the sixth Solvay conference in 1930 was it directly addressed by Einstein, who proposed a gedanken experiment consisting of a box filled with radiation, a clock which controls the opening of a shutter for a time T, and the escape of a photon whose energy Einstein proposed could be measured to an arbitrary precision by weighing the box before and after the opening of the shutter. Therefore, because the energy emitted can be determined with ∆E (as precise as one wants), the product of ∆E and ∆T can be rendered less than what is implied by the UR. Bohr’s response, once seen as a triumphant defense of the time-energy UR, is flawed, as, among other pointed issues, his interpretation of T changes throughout his argument.1,2 Thus, while Bohr’s analysis of the UR is still widely accepted, it fails to be consistent. We thus revisit this specific case of the photon box and aim to verify whether Bohr’s conclusions hold. Our results will shed the light on the proper time-energy uncertainty in a well defined formal context, and in particular, may answer the question whether there is indeed a relation between the validity of time-energy and momentum-position URs.
