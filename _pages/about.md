###  Time-Energy Uncertainty from Einstein's Box

We revisit the specific case of Einstein's photon box _gedankenexperiment_ to shed light on the proper time-energy uncertainty in a well defined formal context, and in particular, try to answer the question whether there is indeed a relation between the validity of time-energy and momentum-position URs.
