Hello! I’m a PhD student at the University of Vienna and at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna. My research in theoretical physics focuses on the intersection of gravity and quantum theory. 

I’m driven by the quest to understand the nature of our universe at the most fundamental level—where profound questions about spacetime, quantum fields, and the fabric of reality come together.

I am also interested in a metaphysical questions concerning the reality of time, identity, and free will. I love hiking and art.
